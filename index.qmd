## Assessing the Impact of Livestock Populations on Nitrous Oxide Emissions by Livestock

Authors: Olivia Gilpin & Josh Ray

### Abstract
Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly increased over recent decades which is the largest contributor to climate change. Agricultural activities, particularly livestock farming, have emerged as major sources of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. However, the extent to which livestock populations influence nitrous oxide emissions remains inadequately quantified, limiting the capacity for informed policy-making and sustainable agricultural practices.Through analyzing annual data (1990-2022) on livestock populations and corresponding nitrous oxide emissions from livestock manure management across the United States. Using statistical analysis including pearson correlation and linear regression we were able to find the relationship between livestock population size and nitrous oxide emissions to quantify the impact of livestock growth on greenhouse gas emissions.Our results show a strong positive correlation between livestock populations and nitrous oxide emissions (r = 0.945, p < 0.001). The regression model indicates that each additional 1,000 head of livestock corresponds to an increase of approximately 0.0048 MMT CO₂e in nitrous oxide emissions, explaining 89.3% of the variance.  Emissions steadily increased by approximately 47% from 1990 to 2019, highlighting a significant and overwhelming upward trend. By identifying livestock population growth as a key driver of increased N₂O emissions, this study provides critical data for stakeholders in agriculture and environmental policy. These findings underscore the urgent need to adopt sustainable agricultural practices and create targeted strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in livestock management systems.

### Introduction

Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly increased over the past few decades, reaching the tipping points of atmospheric and ocean absorption, which has caused catastrophic effects globally. These catastrophic impacts include severe disruptions to weather patterns and ecosystems, which have in turn have globally threatened biodiversity and human health (Filonchyk et al., 2024). The emissions of Greenhouse Gases are primarily derived from various inputs into the atmosphere, heavily including inputs from agricultural processes (Filonchyk et al., 2024). Nitrous oxide, a main Greenhouse Gas emission, is a key contributor to climate change, driven by anthropogenic effects, which have a significant contribution to overall global emissions (Omemen & Aldbbah, 2025). This study will focus on the key component of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide emissions in correlation to agricultural processes.

For this research, we are asking, will the livestock population of livestock have an impact on the level of nitrous oxide emissions? We hypothesize that as the population of livestock increases, the emissions of nitrous oxide will increase. The null hypothesis, if there is no significant relationship between livestock population size and nitrous oxide emissions, an increase in livestock population does not lead to an increase in nitrous oxide emissions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between livestock emissions and greenhouse gas emissions, specifically nitrous oxide. Through this research objective, the goal is to assess whether the population of livestock emissions will influence nitrous oxide emissions.

Narrowing down the sources of nitrous oxide emissions over a temporal scale of the last five years will show us global trends for informing stakeholders on future regulation measures. Global trends to evaluate in correlation to nitrous oxide agricultural emissions would be to look at shifts in agricultural, spatial and temporal factors in relation to intensification of levels of nitrous oxide emissions, and evaluating fertilizer usage. Global climate systems must be further assessed for human influence and the correlation to global nitrous oxide emissions on ecosystem functions (Forster et al., 2024).

Agricultural emissions can be further assessed utilizing longitudinal data analysis, climate models, and remote sensing through the long-term monitoring of the atmosphere. Understanding the environmental consequences of nitrous oxide emissions impacts every sector of life on earth, in addition to the environmental impacts, such as economic, social, and cultural intersections (Yılmaz & Ozaner, 2025). Economic impacts can include the stability or instability of crop yield, which has an impact on the global food market and costs. Culturally, the impact on human health from the decline of air quality can have cultural disruptions within communities, especially those dependent on the natural earth cycles. Through further understanding of the interconnectedness of global nitrous oxide emissions, stakeholders can be better informed about combating the consequences and creating interdisciplinary frameworks. Stakeholders would include agricultural workers, agricultural producers and managers, policymakers, and environmental agencies.  These stakeholders will need to work towards collaborating and creating policies that are ecologically sustainable and socio-economically equitable to assure a  well-rounded approach for the benefit of all stakeholders and global impact considerations.

### Methods

We acquired data from Marshall & Hanson (2024) for this study, which focused on greenhouse gas emissions in correlation to agriculture and forestry-related emissions. From the numerous datasets they provide on the inventory dashboard, we utilized the nitrous oxide Emissions from Livestock Manure Management Systems and the Population of Livestock. The acquired data had a temporal range of 01/01/1990 through 12/21/2022, obtained at an annual frequency, and geographically covered the United States, including all 50 states. These datasets were utilized due to their direct alignment with testing our hypothesis of testing if the population of livestock would have an impact on the level of nitrous oxide emissions. 

Through examining the relationship between nitrous oxide livestock emissions and livestock populations, we took a comparative and statistical analysis approach. This approach included an initial establishment of emission baselines, utilizing national livestock populations and the total nitrous oxide emissions (Marshall & Hanson, 2024). We then utilized the data on nitrous oxide livestock emissions from livestock and analyzed that in comparison to the research on climate variability effects from agricultural practices (Bhatti et al., 2024; Filonchyk et al., 2024; Gołasa et al., 2021; Marshall & Hanson, 2024). We conducted a cross-comparison of nitrous oxide livestock emissions and livestock populations, in order to correlate livestock populations with nitrous oxide livestock emissions, and determine if reductions in livestock populations have an influence on the total outputs of nitrous oxide from livestock. 

For data processing and analysis, we used RStudio, Version 2024.12.1+563 (2024.12.1+563), utilizing various packages to interpret our data, including dplyr, janitor, ggplot2, mediation, readxl, and tidyr. The two primary datasets were saved in our data file as an xlsx file and exported from Excel files using the readxl package for 'Population of Livestock' and 'Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Livestock Manure Management Systems'. After importing and reading the data, we performed several data cleaning steps, including standardizing variable names using the clean_names() function, removing records with missing values (drop_na()), and eliminating duplicate entries (distinct()). We then filtered both datasets in order to specifically focus on the data records categorized as 'Population of Livestock' and 'Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Livestock Manure Management Systems'. In order to compare across variables, we combined the two datasets by year, summing the total livestock population and total nitrous oxide emissions values for each year. These consolidated datasets were then merged using a left join operation based on the year variable, creating a combined dataset with matched annual records of livestock populations and corresponding emissions.

The statistical analysis portion consisted of us conducting a Pearson correlation test to quantify the relationship between livestock population and nitrous oxide emissions. We then developed a linear regression model with livestock population as the independent variable and nitrous oxide emissions as the dependent variable. The results were visualized using scatter plots with regression lines and time series plots showing emission trends across years. All visualizations were created using ggplot2 and saved as PNG files for reporting purposes.

#### Results Explained:
Our pearson correlation showed a very strong positive association between livestock population and N₂O emissions (r₃₁ = 0.945, P < 0.001).Our linear regression indicated that each additional 1,000 head of livestock is associated with an increase of 0.0048 MMT CO₂e in N₂O emissions (β = 4.813 × 10⁻⁶ ± 3.00 × 10⁻⁷, t₃₁ = 16.04, P < 0.001). The model explained 89.3% of the variance in emissions (R² = 0.8925, F₁,₃₁ = 257.4, P < 0.001). Emissions rose steadily from 13.4 MMT CO₂e in 1990 to a peak of 19.7 MMT CO₂e in 2019, representing a 47% increase over the period. A simple linear trend fit (Figure 1) confirms a significant positive slope (≈ 0.17 MMT CO₂e per year; t₃₁ = 11.2, P < 0.001), indicating a consistent upward trajectory. The temporal trend shows emissions have climbed markedly over the last three decades, rising by nearly half, which underscores the environmental impact of expanding livestock sectors as shown in Figure 2 below. Population–emissions relationship shows an extremely high correlation (r = 0.945) and regression results demonstrate that growth in livestock numbers is tightly coupled with increased nitrous oxide emissions.Emissions rose steadily from 13.4 MMT CO₂e in 1990 to a peak of 19.7 MMT CO₂e in 2019, representing a 47% increase over the period. Together, these findings support our hypothesis that increasing livestock populations drive higher nitrous oxide emissions.

### Discussion/Conclusion(s)

In observation of our statistical analysis, we have revealed a strong positive correlation in our study between nitrous oxide emissions and livestock populations. This is indicated in the statistical analysis, which revealed an 89.3% explanation of the variance being explained by the shifts in livestock populations (R² = 0.8925, P < 0.001). This can be seen in Figure 1 above,which demonstrates a strong positive correlation.  From these findings, we have strong support for our hypothesis that states increases in livestock populations lead to higher nitrous oxide emissions, our data specifically indicating that with each additional 1,000 head of livestock, associated with an increase of 0.0048 MMT CO₂e in nitrous oxide emissions. We then saw further support for this relationship through our temporal analysis, which showed a consistent upward trajectory in nitrous oxide emissions with increases in livestock population, culminating in a 47% increase from 1990 to 2019.Figure 2 shown above, showns this temporal trend from 1990 to beyond 2020.

The results found in our research are aligned with research by Filonchyk et al. (2024), which identified that a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions was from agricultural practices. Our research built upon this research by quantifying the relationship between a major greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide, and livestock populations, through providing quantitative evidence. Our evidence is described by researchers Omemen and Aldbbah (2025) as anthropogenic drivers of climate change. Our research on nitrous oxide emissions and the portion of emissions that derive from livestock is also consistent with that of the research by Zhang et al. (2024), which highlights that manure management in livestock farming contributes to approximately 36% of global agricultural-related nitrous oxide emissions.

Our findings have shown the environmental significance of recognizing that nitrous oxide is a significant greenhouse gas with a high global warming potential, nearly 300 times more global warming potential than carbon dioxide in the span of 100 years (Li et al., 2020). Our datasets recording of emissions from the period of 1990-2022 correlates with the research of Forster et al. (2024), which suggests the significance of Nitrous Oxide emissions contribution to the environmental thresholds of the atmospheric and ocean absorption tipping points being reached. Notably, the connection made by Forster et al. (2024) suggests the correlation of nitrous oxide emissions and livestock, specifically livestock as a major contributor. The consistent increases in emissions pose serious implications on our climatic systems as well as ecosystems functions as we look to the future of livestock production, given their significant negative contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. As noted by Akiyama (2024), the rapid increase in nitrous oxide emissions poses significant challenges for mitigation due to the complexity of nitrogen cycling processes. 

When looking towards further research and mitigation, we must consider the global socio-economic perspective and implications that our findings contribute to the discussed interconnectness of environmental sustainability, economic demands, and agriculture practices, namely their complexities, by Yılmaz and Ozaner (2025). This interconnectedness raises serious concerns for agricultural stakeholders and policymakers, as finding a balance in production and protecting the planet requires a deep understanding of the effects of climate change and global agricultural systems, which includes a biogeochemical knowledge base as well. Any changes made to agricultural products have a ripple effect on global food markets, crop yields, and global health, which is why this research is valuable and essential. 

The expected challenges of this research were realizing how vital the integration of the spatial dispersion of livestock populations could have been. Also, whether that could factor into nitrous oxide emission rates based on livestock in a given area and their dispersal. This challenge could help to identify if higher concentrations of livestock in a smaller area of land could impact nitrous oxide emission rates versus a larger area of land for the same amount of livestock, but they are more dispersed versus concentrated. We could consider including geographic data to address this limitation. This could be done by analyzing how livestock density in different regions might affect nitrous oxide emissions. The utilization of mapping tools as well as spatial regression models would help us to better understand if concentrated livestock populations lead to higher emissions compared to more spread-out populations.

Our cumulative findings indicate a strong positive relationship between livestock population and nitrous oxide emissions, indicating a global demand for greenhouse gas mitigation and sustainable agricultural practices. Adapting sustainable agricultural practices will be essential for the longevity of the global rising populations and production demands. Climate change mitigation will be essential alongside the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, as we have shown the direct correlation between the two. This will require a multidisciplinary approach to mitigation, which involves stakeholders from agricultural production, policymakers, community members, environmental agencies, and non-government organizations. Our research has provided evidence to support policy changes towards climate change mitigation and sustainable agricultural practices that consider the social, economic, and environmental perspectives.
