    "text": "Authors: Olivia Gilpin & Josh Ray\n\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions have significantly increased over the past few decades, reaching the tipping points of atmospheric and ocean absorption, which has caused catastrophic effects globally. These catastrophic impacts include severe disruptions to weather patterns and ecosystems, which have in turn have globally threatened biodiversity and human health (Filonchyk et al., 2024). The emissions of Greenhouse Gases are primarily derived from various inputs into the atmosphere, heavily including inputs from agricultural processes (Filonchyk et al., 2024). Nitrous Oxide, a main Greenhouse Gas emission, is a key contributor to climate change, driven by anthropogenic effects, which have a significant contribution to overall global emissions (Omemen & Aldbbah, 2025). This study will focus on the key component of the greenhouse gas Nitrous Oxide emissions in correlation to agricultural processes. \nFor this research, we are asking, will the livestock population of livestock have an impact on the level of Nitrous Oxide emissions? We hypothesize that as the population of livestock increases, the emissions of Nitrous Oxide will increase. The null hypothesis, if there is no significant relationship between livestock population size and Nitrous Oxide emissions, an increase in livestock population does not lead to an increase in Nitrous Oxide emissions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between livestock emissions and greenhouse gas emissions, specifically Nitrous Oxide. Through this research objective, the goal is to assess whether the population of livestock emissions will influence Nitrous Oxide emissions.\nNarrowing down the sources of Nitrous Oxide emissions over a temporal scale of the last five years will show us global trends for informing stakeholders on future regulation measures. Global trends to evaluate in correlation to Nitrous Oxide agricultural emissions would be to look at shifts in agricultural, spatial and temporal factors in relation to intensification of levels of Nitrous Oxide emissions, and evaluating fertilizer usage. Global climate systems must be further assessed for human influence and the correlation to global Nitrous Oxide emissions on ecosystem functions (Forster et al., 2024).\nAgricultural emissions can be further assessed utilizing longitudinal data analysis, climate models, and remote sensing through the long-term monitoring of the atmosphere. Understanding the environmental consequences of Nitrous Oxide emissions impacts every sector of life on earth, in addition to the environmental impacts, such as economic, social, and cultural intersections (Yılmaz & Ozaner, 2025). Economic impacts can include the stability or instability of crop yield, which has an impact on the global food market and costs. Culturally, the impact on human health from the decline of air quality can have cultural disruptions within communities, especially those dependent on the natural earth cycles. Through further understanding of the interconnectedness of global nitrous oxide emissions, stakeholders can be better informed about combating the consequences and creating interdisciplinary frameworks. Stakeholders would include agricultural workers, agricultural producers and managers, policymakers, and environmental agencies. These stakeholders will need to work towards collaborating and creating policies that are ecologically sustainable and socio-economically equitable for well-rounded for the benefit of all stakeholders and global impact considerations.\n\n\n\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(janitor)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'janitor'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    chisq.test, fisher.test\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(mediation)\n\nLoading required package: MASS\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'MASS'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    select\n\n\nLoading required package: Matrix\n\n\nLoading required package: mvtnorm\n\n\nLoading required package: sandwich\n\n\nmediation: Causal Mediation Analysis\nVersion: 4.5.0\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'tidyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:Matrix':\n\n    expand, pack, unpack\n\nsheet1_path &lt;- \"data/Population of Livestock.xlsx\"\nsheet2_path &lt;- \"data/Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Livestock Manure Management Systems.xlsx\"\n\ndata1 &lt;- read_excel(sheet1_path)\ndata2 &lt;- read_excel(sheet2_path)\n\nstr(data1)\n\ntibble [42,900 × 7] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ state_long                : chr [1:42900] \"Alaska\" \"Alaska\" \"Alaska\" \"Alaska\" ...\n $ state_short               : chr [1:42900] \"AK\" \"AK\" \"AK\" \"AK\" ...\n $ supplemental_category     : chr [1:42900] \"Population of Livestock\" \"Population of Livestock\" \"Population of Livestock\" \"Population of Livestock\" ...\n $ supplemental_subcategory_1: chr [1:42900] \"Beef NOF Bull\" \"Beef NOF Bull\" \"Beef NOF Bull\" \"Beef NOF Bull\" ...\n $ unit                      : chr [1:42900] \"1,000 head\" \"1,000 head\" \"1,000 head\" \"1,000 head\" ...\n $ value                     : num [1:42900] 1.6 1.7 1.5 1.3 1.6 1.9 2.4 2.9 2 1.9 ...\n $ year                      : chr [1:42900] \"2000\" \"2001\" \"2002\" \"2003\" ...\n\nstr(data2)\n\ntibble [117,150 × 9] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ ghg                       : chr [1:117150] \"N₂O\" \"N₂O\" \"N₂O\" \"N₂O\" ...\n $ state_long                : chr [1:117150] \"Alaska\" \"Alaska\" \"Alaska\" \"Alaska\" ...\n $ state_short               : chr [1:117150] \"AK\" \"AK\" \"AK\" \"AK\" ...\n $ supplemental_category     : chr [1:117150] \"Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Livestock Manure Management Systems\" \"Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Livestock Manure Management Systems\" \"Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Livestock Manure Management Systems\" \"Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Livestock Manure Management Systems\" ...\n $ supplemental_subcategory_1: chr [1:117150] \"Beef OF Heifers\" \"Beef OF Heifers\" \"Beef OF Heifers\" \"Beef OF Heifers\" ...\n $ supplemental_subcategory_2: chr [1:117150] \"Cattle Deep Litter (&gt;1 month)\" \"Cattle Deep Litter (&gt;1 month)\" \"Cattle Deep Litter (&gt;1 month)\" \"Cattle Deep Litter (&gt;1 month)\" ...\n $ unit                      : chr [1:117150] \"MMT CO₂e\" \"MMT CO₂e\" \"MMT CO₂e\" \"MMT CO₂e\" ...\n $ value                     : num [1:117150] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ year                      : chr [1:117150] \"2000\" \"2001\" \"2002\" \"2003\" ...\n\ndata1 &lt;- data1 %&gt;%\n  clean_names() %&gt;%\n  drop_na() %&gt;%\n  distinct()\n\ndata2 &lt;- data2 %&gt;%\n  clean_names() %&gt;%\n  drop_na() %&gt;%\n  distinct()\n\ndata_livestock &lt;- data1 %&gt;% \n  filter(supplemental_category == \"Population of Livestock\")\n\ndata_emissions &lt;- data2 %&gt;% \n  filter(supplemental_category == \"Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Livestock Manure Management Systems\")\n\ndata_livestock_aggregated &lt;- data_livestock %&gt;%\n  group_by(year) %&gt;%\n  summarise(value_livestock = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE))\n\ndata_emissions_aggregated &lt;- data_emissions %&gt;%\n  group_by(year) %&gt;%\n  summarise(value_emissions = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE))\n\ndata_combined &lt;- left_join(data_livestock_aggregated, data_emissions_aggregated, by = \"year\")\n\nhead(data_combined)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  year  value_livestock value_emissions\n  &lt;chr&gt;

This approach would include an initial establishment of emission baselines, utilizing national livestock populations and the total Nitrous Oxide emissions (Marshall & Hanson, 2024). We would then utilize the data on Nitrous Oxide livestock emissions from livestock and analyze that in comparison to the research on climate variability effects from agricultural practices (Bhatti et al., 2024; Filonchyk et al., 2024; Gołasa et al., 2021; Marshall & Hanson, 2024). A cross-comparison of Nitrous Oxide livestock emissions and livestock populations, in order to correlate livestock populations with Nitrous Oxide livestock emissions, and determine if reductions in livestock populations have an influence on the total outputs of Nitrous Oxide from livestock. For the statistical analysis, we would run a correlation analysis, a regression model, and a mediating analysis to evaluate the empirical significance of relationships. \nThe expected challenges of this research that we anticipate will be the lack of inclusion of the spatial dispersion of livestock populations factor, and whether that could factor into Nitrous Oxide emission rates based on livestock in a given area and their dispersal. This is an important challenge to be aware of in order to identify if higher concentrations of livestock in a smaller area of land could impact Nitrous Oxide emission rates versus a larger area of land for the same amount of livestock, but they are more dispersed versus concentrated. This limitation could be addressed by including geographic data to analyze how livestock density in different regions might affect nitrous oxide emissions. By using mapping tools and spatial regression models, we could better understand if concentrated livestock populations lead to higher emissions compared to more spread-out populations.\n\n\n\n(Bhatti et al., 2024)\n(TRACE, n.d.)\n(Filonchyk, Peterson, Zhang, Hurynovich, & He, 2024)\n(Forster et al., 2024)\n(Gołasa et al., 2021)\n(Nagelkerken & Connell, 2015)\n(Omemen & Aldbbah, 2025)\n(Data, n.d.)\n(Siddik, Islam, Zaman, & Hasan, 2021)\n(Yılmaz & Ozaner, 2025)\n(Bank, n.d.)"

This approach would include an initial establishment of emission baselines, utilizing national livestock populations and the total Nitrous Oxide emissions (Marshall & Hanson, 2024). We would then utilize the data on Nitrous Oxide livestock emissions from livestock and analyze that in comparison to the research on climate variability effects from agricultural practices (Bhatti et al., 2024; Filonchyk et al., 2024; Gołasa et al., 2021; Marshall & Hanson, 2024). A cross-comparison of Nitrous Oxide livestock emissions and livestock populations, in order to correlate livestock populations with Nitrous Oxide livestock emissions, and determine if reductions in livestock populations have an influence on the total outputs of Nitrous Oxide from livestock. For the statistical analysis, we would run a correlation analysis, a regression model, and a mediating analysis to evaluate the empirical significance of relationships. \nThe expected challenges of this research that we anticipate will be the lack of inclusion of the spatial dispersion of livestock populations factor, and whether that could factor into Nitrous Oxide emission rates based on livestock in a given area and their dispersal. This is an important challenge to be aware of in order to identify if higher concentrations of livestock in a smaller area of land could impact Nitrous Oxide emission rates versus a larger area of land for the same amount of livestock, but they are more dispersed versus concentrated. This limitation could be addressed by including geographic data to analyze how livestock density in different regions might affect nitrous oxide emissions. By using mapping tools and spatial regression models, we could better understand if concentrated livestock populations lead to higher emissions compared to more spread-out populations.\n\n\n\n(Bhatti et al., 2024)\n(TRACE, n.d.)\n(Filonchyk, Peterson, Zhang, Hurynovich, & He, 2024)\n(Forster et al., 2024)\n(Gołasa et al., 2021)\n(Nagelkerken & Connell, 2015)\n(Omemen & Aldbbah, 2025)\n(Data, n.d.)\n(Siddik, Islam, Zaman, & Hasan, 2021)\n(Yılmaz & Ozaner, 2025)\n(Bank, n.d.)"
